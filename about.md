#### [Curriculum vitae](/cv.pdf) ####

I am currently a **[postdoctoral researcher](http://idmod.org/team/bio/55%20)** at the [Institute for Disease Modeling](http://idmod.org) in Seattle, WA.  There I apply stochastic dynamical systems theory to **[HIV modeling](http://idmod.org/research/hiv)** and more generally to algorithm design for stochastic dynamical systems in the context of epidemiological modeling.

I received my Ph.D. from the department of [Electrical Engineering](http://ee.washington.edu) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu) in 2014.  As a **[Ph.D. student](http://depts.washington.edu/soslab/mw/index.php?title=User:Oishi)** in the [Klavins lab](http://klavinslab.org), I developed frameworks for engineering technomimetic dynamical and computational systems in **[DNA and synthetic biological organisms](http://klavinslab.org)**.

In 2006 I completed my M.S. in [Robotics](http://ri.cmu.edu) from [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu).  CMU I worked on passive control for **[dynamic legged climbing robots]()** under the advise of [Professor Alfred A. Rizzi](http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alfred_Rizzi) in the [Microdynamic Systems Laboratory](http://www.ri.cmu.edu/research_lab_group_detail.html?type=description&lab_id=10&menu_id=263).
